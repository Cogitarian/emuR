# Introduction

This document introduces and defines version 2 of the **E**mu **Q**uery **L**anguage (**EQL**) and tries to show what it is capable of by giving numerous examples. The EQL is a query language that is aimed at speech and language researchers that is supposed to be easy to understand and learn yet expressive and powerful. It enables researchers to easily query annotation structures of databases stored in the emuDB format. The `emuR` package provides a `query()` function to query emuDBs that are loaded into the current R session (for more information see the `emuR_intro` as well as the `emuDB` vignettes). The main argument of the `query()` function is the `query` argument (`query(..., query="XXX", ...)` where `XXX` is the query string). In this document we will be focusing soley on this argument and the query strings that can be passed into it.  

To revise what was already mentioned in the `emuR_intro` as well as the `emuDB` vignette: The annotation structure of an `emuDB` can be thought of as a graph. Each annotation consist of annotational units (called ITEMs) that are grouped together in an ordered array. Each ITEM can be linked to other ITEMs of other levels if an according linkDefinition is present in the `emuDB`. An exemplary excerpt of such an annotation can be seen below.

![Alt text](pics/msajc003.svg)

As we will not be mentioning it thoughout the rest of the vignette: one thing to note about the `query()` function are the parameters `bundlePattern` and `sessionPattern`. These can be used to restrict which session and bundle the query will be run against. They both expect a regular expression string to restrict the sessions or bundles one wishes to query.

# Examples

We will jump right in by giving you a bunch of examples of the query string that where adapted from [@harrington:2002, @cassidy_harrington:2001].

## Simple queries (single argument)

- All ITEMs containing the label "m" in the "Phonetic" level: `"[Phonetic == m]"`
- All ITEMs containing the label "m" or "n" in the "Phonetic" level: `"[Phonetic == m | n]"`
- All ITEMs that don't contain the label "m" oder "n": `"[Phonetic != m | n]"`
- All ITEMs in the "Syllable" level: `"[Syllable =~ .*]"`
- All ITEMs in the "Text" level beginning with 'fi': `"[Text =~ fi.*]"`


*Note: The above examples use two new operands. One beeing the "==" equal operand that has the same meaning as the "=" operand of EQL1 while providing a cleaner more precise syntax. The other beeing the "=~" which is the new regular expression operand.*

## Sequence queries using the "->" sequence operand

The general syntax of a query string using the "->" sequence operand is `"[L == A -> L == B]"` where element "A" on level "L" precedes element "B" on level "L". For a sequential query to work both arguments must be on the same level (alternativly parallel attributeDefinitions of the same level may also be chosen).
   
- A sequence of "m" followed by "I" ITEMs on the "Phonetic"" level: `"[Phonetic == m -> Phonetic == I]"`** (all row entries in the segment list have the start time of "m"" and end time of "I" and the labels will be "m->I")
- Same as above but this time we are only interessted in the "m" ITEMs: `"[#Phonetic == m -> Phonetic == I]"`  (all row entries in the segment list have the start time of "m" and the end time of "m")  
- Same as above but this time we are only interessted in the "I" ITEMs:   `"[Phonetic == m -> #Phonetic == I]"`

## Subsequent sequence queries using nesting of the "->" sequence operand   

The general syntax to performing subsequent sequences of labels is to nest muliple sequences while paying attention to the correct placement of the parentheses. An abstracted version of a query string for the subsequent sequence of arguments A1, A2, A3, A4 would be: `"[[[[A1-> A2] -> A3] -> A4] -> a5]"`  

- All sequences of ITEMs containing ["m" "I" "n"] labels on the "Phonetic" level: `"[[ Phonetic == m -> Phonetic == I ] -> Phonetic == n ]"` 
- All sequences of ITEMs containing ["john"" "could" "lend"] labels on the "Text" level: `"[[ Text == john -> Text == could ] -> Text == lend ]"`
- All sequences of ITEMs containging labels "the" followed by two arbitrary labels followed by "managed" `"[[[Text == the -> Text =~ .*] -> Text =~ .* ] -> Text == managed]"`

*Note: As the EQL1 didn't have a regular expression operand users often resorted to using queries such as "[Phonetic != XXX]" (where XXX is a label that was not part of the labels selt of the "Phonetic" level) to match every label on the "Phonetic" level. Although this is still possible in the EQL2 we strongly recommend using regular expressions as these provide a much clearer and preciser syntax.*


## The conjunction operand &

Syntax: `"[L1 == a & L2 == b & L3 == c & L4 == d & ... & Ln == n]"`
Semantics: All a elements on level L1 which have properties b, c, d..n as well.  
Condition: All arguments must be on the same level or linear level  


- S syllables which are labeled with L+H\* too: `"[Syllable == S & Pitch_Accent == L+H*]"`
- Text of all function words `"[Text != x & Word == F]"`
- Text of all content words which are also accentuated (S) `"[Text != x & Word == C & Accent == S]"`

## The disjunction operand |



## Hierarchical queries using the domination operand ^

Syntax: Semantik: `"[L1 == a ^ L2 == b]"`
Semantics: a dominated by b or a dominated by b  
Condition: L1 dominates L2 or L2 dominates L1

### Simple Domination

- All "p"" phonemes in S Syllables  `"[Phoneme = p ^ Syllable = S]"`
- All syllables, which contain a phonmeme /p/  `"[Syllable != x ^ Phoneme = p]"` or `"[Phoneme = p ^ #Syllable =~ .*]"`
- All syllables, which neither contain /k/ nor /p/ nor /t/  `"[Syllable != x ^ Phoneme != p | t | k]"` or `"[Phoneme != p | t | k ^ # Syllable =~ .*]"`

### Multiple Domination

A dominance relationship sequence a1, a2, a3, a4, is noted this way:  **[[[[a1 ^ a2] ^ a3] ^ a4] ^ a5]**  

- H\* syllables containing a phoneme /p/, dominated by words ‘price’ or ‘space' `"[[Pitch_Accent == H\* ^ Phoneme = p] ^ Text == price | space]"`  
- The same – but we want the appropriate words: `"[[Pitch_Accent == H* ^ Phoneme == p] ^ #Text == price | space]"`


## Position

### Simple usage

Syntax: **Start(La, Lb) = 1  **
Semantics: Lb occurs at the beginning of La
Condition: La dominates Lb  
Note: Simple usage generates the segment list of Lb

- Syllables at begining of word `"[Start(Word, Syllable) == 1]"`
- Phonemes at begining of word `"[Start(Word, Phoneme) == 1]"`
- Syllables not at begining of word `"[Start(Word, Syllable) == 0]"`
- Functions Medial(La, Lb) and End(La, Lb)
- Word-final syllables "`[End(Word, Syllable) == 1]"` and so on  

## Position and Boolean &
Syntax: L = e & Start(La, Lb) = 1  
Semantics: Element e on level L occurs at the bginning of La  
Condition: La dominates Lb  (L and Lb are on the same level or linear level).  

- All /p/ phonemes at the beginning of a syllable  `"[Phoneme == p & Start(Syllable, Phoneme) == 1]"`  
- All word-final /m/ phonemes `"[Phoneme = m & End(Word, Phoneme)=1]"`
- All non-word-final "S"" syllables which are labeled with tonic accent L+H\*  `"[Syllable =S & Pitch_Accent=L+H* & (Word, Syllable)=0]"`

### Position and Boolean ^
Syntax/Semantics as for 5.2, but:
If L und Lb are different levels (L dominates Lb, or Lb dominates L) use ^ instead of & :

- /p/ phonemes, which occur in the first syllable of the word  `"[Phoneme = p ^ Start(Word, Syllable)=1]"`
- All phonemes, which do not occur in the last syllable of the word `"[Phoneme !=x ^ End(Word, Syllable)=0]"`

## Count

Syntax: **Num(La, Lb) = n**
Semantics: La contains n Lb elements
Condition: La dominates Lb. n is a number
Note: Generates segment list on La (not on Lb, as with 4-syllable words position)
**`[Num(Word, Syllable)=4]`**  
There are also the operators > (more than), < (less than) and != (not equal).  
Syllables, which have more than 6 phonemes
**`[Num(Syllable, Phoneme)>6]`**  
and so on  

### Count and Boolean &

Syntax: **L = e & Num(La, Lb) = n**  
Semantics: Element e on level L is dominated by La ; and La contains n Lb elements, La dominates Lb  
Condition: (L and La (not Lb!) are on the same level or linear level).  

- Text of all words, which consist of 11 phonemes: `"[Text!=x & Num(Text, Phoneme) > 11 ] ="` or  `"[Text =~ .* & Num(Word, Phoneme) > 11]"`
- H\* tonic accents in syllables of 5 phonemes:  `"[Pitch_Accent = H* & Num(Syllable, Phoneme) = 5]"`

### Count and ^

Syntax/Semantics as with 6.2, but:
If L and La are different levels (L dominates La, or La dominates L) use ^ instead of & :
- All m phonemes in 4-syllable words  `"[Phoneme == m ^ Num(Word, Syllable) == 4]"`
- All W-Syllables in words of 3 or less syllables `"[Syllable = W ^ Num(Word, Syllable) < 3]"`
- All words, which contain syllable, which contain 4 phonemes  `[Text != x ^ Num(Syllable, Phoneme) == 4]"`

## Combinations

### ^ and -> (Domination and Sequence)  
Condition: The sequence -> must connect only same or levels or linear levels! (See 2.)
**[[a1 ^ a2] -> a3] [a1 -> [a2 ^ a3]]**  

- m precedes I and m is part of a S-syllable  `"[[Phoneme = m -> Phoneme = I] ^ Syllable=S]"`
- s precedes p and p is part of a W-syllable  `"[Phoneme = s -> [Phoneme = p ^ Syllable = W]]"`
- all S-syllables, which contain phoneme p and precede a S-syllable  `"[[Syllable = S ^ Phoneme = p] -> Syllable = S]"`
- but now we want p: p is part of a S-syllable and this S-syllable precedes a S-syllable: `"[[Phoneme = p ^ Syllable = S] -> Syllable = S]"`
- Not allowed! Because Phoneme = p and Syllable = S are not on the same level, therefore:  `"[[Syllable = S ^ #Phoneme=p] -> Syllable = S]"`

**8.2. ^ and -> and & (Domination and Sequence and Boolean &)**  
Words, beginning with a schwa:  
**`[Text!=x ^ Phoneme = @ & Start(Text, Phoneme)=1]`**
A word-begining m in a string syllbale, which precedes I  
**`[[Phoneme = m & Start(Word, Phoneme)=1 -> Phoneme=I] ^ Syllable=S]`**  
same but we want the text:  
**`[[[Phoneme = m & Start(Word, Phoneme)=1 -> Phoneme=I] ^ Syllable=S] ^ #Text!=x]`**
The text of all three-syllable words, which contain a schwa in the first syllable; these three-syllable words must precede ‘the’
The text of all three-syllable words  
1. Text!=x & Num(Text, Syllable)=3  
Schwa occurs in the first syllable  
2. Phoneme=@ ^ Start(Word, Syllable)=1  
The text is ‘the’  
3. Text = the  
[1 ^ 2]  
[[1 ^ 2] -> 3]

**`[[Text!=x & Num(Text, Syllable) =3 ^ [Phoneme=@ ^ Start(Word, Syllable)=1]] -> Text=the ]`**  

##**Questions**
1. m or n phonemes, which occur in the middle of the word.  
2. [H] phonetic segments, next an arbitrary segment, next either [I] or [U].  
3. Syllables, which do not occur in the middle of a word.  
4. The text of all words, which contain two syllables.  
5. The text of all accentuated words following ‘the’.  
6. S syllables consisting of 5 phonemes.  
7. W syllables, which contain a /@/ phoneme.  
8. The text of words, which contain either a L\* or L\+H\* a tonic accent.  
9. H\* tonic accents of word-final syllables, which occur in three-syllable words.  
10. All phonemes, dominating Phonetic element [H], at the beginning of a syllable; and which occur in accentuated (S) words.

1. m or n phonemes, which occur in the middle of the word.  
`[Phoneme = m | n & Medial(Word, Phoneme)=1]`  
2. [H] phonetic segments, next an arbitrary segment, next either [I] or [U].  
`[ [Phonetic = H -> Phonetic !=x ] -> Phonetic = I | U ]`  
3.  Syllables, which do not occur in the middle of a word.  
`[Syllable!=x & Medial(Word, Syllable)=0]`  
4.The text of all words, which contain two syllables.

6. S syllables consisting of 5 phonemes.  
`[Syllable = S ^ Num(Word, Phoneme)=5]`  
7.  W syllables, which contain a /@/ phoneme.  
`[Syllable = W ^ Phoneme=@]`  
8. The text of words, which contain either a L\* or L\+H\* a tonic accent.  
`[Text!=x ^ Pitch_Accent = L* | L+H*]`
9. H\* tonic accents of word-final syllables, which occur in three-syllable words.  
`[Pitch_Accent = H* & End(Word, Syllable)=1 ^ Num(Word, Syllable) =3]`  
10. All phonemes, dominating Phonetic element [H], at the beginning of a syllable; and which occur in accentuated (S) words.  
`[[[Phoneme!=x ^ Phonetic = H] ^ Start(Word, Syllable)=1] ^ Accent = S]`  


# Differences and incompatibilities to legacy EMU query language (R package 'emu', version 4.2)

## Function call syntax
For emuR it is required that the emuDB is loaded in current R session using function load_emuDB.

EQL2 query function is part of R package emuR. See help(query)  
Examples:
```
query('andosl',"[Phoneme = p ^ Syllable = S]")
```
Session and bundle selection patterns are optional and expect regular expression patterns.

Example:
```
query('andosl',"[Phoneme = p ^ Syllable = S]",sessionPattern='000.',bundlePattern='msajc0[1-2].')
```

Parameter sessionPattern has no effect here (andosl is a legacy import emuDB and has only one dummy session '0000').  
Parameter bundlePattern selects all bundle names starting with 'msajc01' or 'msajc02'.


## Result type

Default result type of a query is an object of R S3 class 'emuRsegs'. The class inherits legacy Emu class 'emusegs' and R standard class 'data.frame'. That means it is mostly compatible to the legacy seglist, but contains some additional data, e.g. the ID's of start and end item of each segment.
Each row of this data.frame is a sequence of one or more annotation elements on one level; a segment.   
Details:
```
help(emuRsegs)
```
emuR returns an empty segment list (zero row count) if the query does not match any element, in opposite to legacy Emu which throws an error: ("Can't find the query results in emu.query: there may have been a problem with the query command.")


## Bundle (utterance) names

emuR package arranges bundles (utterances) in sessions. Converted legacy EMU databases have one default session '0000' containing all bundles. Therefore the 'utts' column of all segment lists is prefixed by the session name and starts with '0000:' for example '0000:msajc003'.
See emuDB vignette for details.

## The result modifier hash tag '#'

Legacy Emu allows multiple occurences of the hash tag '#' in a query.

emuR allows only one single hash tag '#' in a query.

If you want multiple results in one segment list, it is recommended do concatenate the results of separate queries and position the hash tag to different places in these queries to get desired results.

## Interpretation of the hash character '#' in logical AND combined terms
#### legacy Emu
```
> emu.query('andosl','*','[Text=spring & #Accent=S]')
moving data from Tcl to R
Read 1 records
segment  list from database:  andosl 
query was:  [Text=spring & #Accent=S] 
  labels    start      end     utts
1 spring 2288.959 2704.466 msajc094

> emu.query('andosl','*','[#Text=spring & #Accent=S]')
moving data from Tcl to R
Read 1 records
segment  list from database:  andosl 
query was:  [#Text=spring & #Accent=S] 
  labels    start      end     utts
1 spring 2288.959 2704.466 msajc094
```
The hash character has no effect to both queries

#### emuR
```
> query(andosl,"[Text=spring & #Accent=S]",resultType='emusegs')
segment  list from database:  andosl 
query was:  [Text=spring & #Accent=S] 
  labels    start      end          utts
1      S 2288.975 2704.475 0000:msajc094
```
Returns the same segment (same item), but with the label of the hashed attribute name.
The second legacy example is not valid in emuR query (two hash tags).

```
> query('andosl',"[#Text=spring & #Accent=S]")

 Error in query.database.eql.KONJA(dbConfig, qTrim) : 
  Only one hashtag allowed in linear query term: #Text=spring & #Accent=S 
```

EQL2 throws an error here, because to fulfill the request it would be necessary to return each item doubled to get both Text and Accent labels.  

## Probable bugs in legacy EMU EQL

### Alternative labels in not equal conditional query
Example:
#### (legacy) emu
```
> emu.query('ae','*',"[Text!=beautiful|futile ^ Phoneme=u:]")
moving data from Tcl to R
Read 4 records
segment  list from database:  ae 
query was:  [Text!=beautiful|futile ^ Phoneme=u:] 
     labels    start      end     utts
1       new  475.802  666.743 msajc057
2    futile  571.999 1091.000 msajc010
3        to 1091.000 1222.389 msajc010
4 beautiful 2033.739 2604.489 msajc003
```
I assume that the OR operator '|' is ignored in connection with the not equal operator '!='

#### emuR
```
> query(ae,"[Text!=beautiful|futile ^ Phoneme=u:]",resultType='emusegs')
segment  list from database:  ae 
query was:  [Text!=beautiful|futile ^ Phoneme=u:] 
  labels    start      end          utts
1     to 1091.025 1222.375 0000:msajc010
2    new  475.825  666.725 0000:msajc057
```

### Errors caused by missing blanks

Legacy Emu query requires blanks around some operators or brackets in some queries. If these blanks are missing compiler errors or even crashes will occur for some query strings. 

emuR accepts these queries without blanks.

### Order of result segment list
It is unknown if legacy Emu returns the seglist ordered.
emuR returns emuRsegs result lists ordered by UUID,session,bundle and sample start position and emusegs lists by the fields utts and start.

### Additional features

emuR accepts also the double equal character string '==' as equal operator.

emuR EQL2 has the capability to query labels by matching regular expressions using the '=~' (match) and '!~' (not match) operators.

#### Example
```
> query('andosl',"Text=~.*tz.*")
segment  list from database:  andosl 
query was:  Text=~.*tz.* 
   labels    start      end session   bundle startItemID endItemID type
1 blitzed 1586.875 2112.475    0000 msadb081          54        54 ITEM
2 blitzed 1540.225 2022.475    0000 msajc081          59        59 ITEM
```
